linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set
sort x and y data from smallest to largest using sorted
define n to be the length of the array 
ompute the first quartile index
compute the third quartile index 
sort the x and y values again
compute interquartile range 
make sure the x and y values align correctly and they don't you need to change it or it won't work 
check sizes and sort them again and make sure they align 
find the mean of x and y values 
slope = ((length(sortedX).*(sum(sortedX.*sortedY)))-((sum(sortedX)).*(sum(sortedY))))./((length(sortedX).*sum(sortedX.^2))-((sum(sortedX)).^2));%calculates the slope 
intercept = meany-(slope.*meanx);%getting the b/intercept of mx+b
f = @(x) intercept+slope.*x;%lastly putting it all together with an anonymous function 
total sum of squares 
sum of squares of residuals 
compute rsquared
