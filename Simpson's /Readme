Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
check the size of the inputs
compute the difference of the values from one another 
check to see if the inputs are equally spaced 
if mod(length(x),2) == 0%this checks the length because simpson's 1/3 rule can only work with even amount of data points so now we need to finish the algoithm off with the trap rule if it exceeds 4
step =step size b-a
n= number of segments 
I = y(1)+y(end)+4*sum(y(2:2:end-1))+2*sum(y(3:2:end-2));% using simpson's 1/3
I = I+(y(end-1)+y(end)).*(step./2)%using trap for the rest of values that the simposon's 1/3 didn't cover
