falsePosition finds the root of a function using false position method

iter initial iteration 
ea current error
nargin is number of input arguments and if it is less than 3 we have to tell the user to have more 
even amount of inputs means using the bounds within the loop
es stopping criteria
maxit the maximum amount of iterations 
we want the ea to become less than than the stopping criteria error which is .0001
func(xl) func(xu) we want to evaluate the function at both the upper and lower bounds given 
root= xu-(((xuu).*(xl-xu))./(xll-xuu)); this is the first iteration of the false position and then the rest of the code will change the new value to the new estimation aquired every time we go through the loop
