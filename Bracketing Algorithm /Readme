Define the function to be solved for. Is the angle specified in radians or degrees?
correct ramge for an angle is what my x bounds are. 
func(x) evaluates the x within the function
We want to plot the function to get a better understanding of where the root is and make sure we have all the axis titles and grid added in to make it look nice. 
xl= lower bound
xu= upper bound 
fprint is going to print the answer within '' and then the word(s) afterward
