# Mech-105-Algorithms
This contains many algorithm assignments I created during my time in my Mechanical Engineering 105 class. Each algorithm was for us to portray our understanding of what each algorithm could do and within each folder they have a set of instructions of how each function works. These algorithms were written in MatLab and can be used for various task.
